        <h2>My Favorite Movie</h2>
         <p>My favorite movie is probably <cite>Spider-man 3</cite>. I personally think that the <strong>Toby Maguire</strong> spiderman movies are the <em>best</em>. I grew up watching <cite>Spider-man</cite> with my brother and we enjoyed 3 the most. <mark>It's not like I disliked the rest of the movies, I just <em>really</em> enjoyed the third one.</mark> Something about the darker tone of the venom suit, the emotional struggles Peter goes through, and even the music makes it stand out to me. I think the pacing of the movie was really great, there wasn't many boring parts. The movie is just tied to a lot of nostalgia so i love it.</p>
          <p>Another movie/movie series I tend to enjoy and watch all the time is the <strong> Christian Bale</strong> <cite> Batman Trilogy</cite>. I have always just enjoyed these movies and I go back and rewatch them at least once a year. I actually just got done rewatching them this past weekend. What I like most about this trilogy is how grounded and normal it feels compared to other superhero movies. The characters feel realistic, the villains are really memorable, and the movies take themselves seriously without losing entertainment value. And who doesnt love <cite>Heath Ledger</cite> as the <cite>Joker</cite>.</p>
          <p>I think I am just naturally drawn to superhero movies that also show the <em>human</em> side of being a hero. Both of these movies show the human behind the mask and the struggle they go through to be the hero everyone needs. This makes the characters relatable and it makes it feel like <mark>anyone can be a hero, even yourself</mark>. I always enjoy movies that leave you with a <strong>gut feeling</strong> and they do that perfectly.</p>
          <p>Movies have always been <em>more</em> than just entertainment for me. They are something I associate with <strong>comfort</strong> and <strong>memories</strong>. A lot of the time I dont even watch for the plot anymore, it’s more about how the movie makes me <em>feel</em>. Certain movies remind me of being younger or staying up late rewatching the same things I already know by heart. I think that’s why I keep going back to the same movies over and over. They’re familiar and predictable. Even when life feels busy or overwhelming, putting on a movie I’ve already seen a hundred times feels like revisiting a place I know I’m comfortable in.</p>
